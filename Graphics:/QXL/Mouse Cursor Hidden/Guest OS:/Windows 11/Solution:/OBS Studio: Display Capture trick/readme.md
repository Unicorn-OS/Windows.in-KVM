# OBS source: "Display Capture" Fix
In OBS Studio if you create an "Scene" that has a source "Display Capture", Even when you're not recording It will make your Cursor render on any QXL or virtual Display!
I don't know how it works? But this shows there's a Programatic fix!
You can also minimize OBS to tray to have it running full time!

Requires:
- passed through USB Mouse
- OBS Studio (Not recording)
- QXL display device
